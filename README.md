This repository contains all the labs I completed in my intro to data analysis course, provided by Microsoft through edX in which I received my certificate. When you click to view the lab, you will then see a blue link which states "view raw". When you click that link, it will then download my Excel spreadsheet so you can view my lab.

Lab 1: In my first lab I had to analyze a real world data set. I then had to create a scatterplot in Excel showing the relationship between two variables. Lastly, I had to compute the correlation efficient between two variables with Excel's built in =CORREL() function.

Lab 2: In my second lab I had to analyze a real world data set and identify which variables were nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.

Lab 3: In my third lab, I had to perform inner joins, Full outer joins, left joins and right joins by hand using Excel.
