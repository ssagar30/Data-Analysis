This repository contains all the labs I completed in my intro to data analysis course, provided by Microsoft through edX in which I received my certificate. When you click to view the lab, you will then see a blue link which states "view raw". When you click that link, it will then download my Excel spreadsheet so you can view my lab.

Lab 1: In my first lab I had to analyze a real world data set. I then had to create a scatterplot in Excel showing the relationship between two variables. Lastly, I had to compute the correlation efficient between two variables with Excel's built in =CORREL() function.

Lab 2: In my second lab I had to analyze a real world data set and identify which variables were nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio.

Lab 3: In my third lab, I had to perform inner joins, Full outer joins, left joins and right joins by hand using Excel.

Lab 4: In my fourth lab, I had to calculate the mean, median and mode of a data set using Excel. I also had to calculate the standard deviation as well as the skewness using Excel. 

Lab 5: In my fifth lab, I provided visualization for a data set compromised of four variables pertaining to movies. The first variable was movieid, the second was runtime(in minutes), the third was the rating and the fourth was liking. I filtered the movieid variable by ascending order. I then highlighted the entire data set in the runtime column. I inserted a line graph, giving my graph a title and labeling both axis. The line graph displays the runtime for each individual movie. Hightlighting the same varaible I inserted a histogram which displays bins on the x-axis. The y-axis displays the number of movies that falls within a bin. For the last graph, I wanted to visualize the amount of movies that contained one of the four rating variables. I had to use a bar graph because the data is categorical and not numerical. I first had to arrange the data into numbers so Excel's bar graph function can read it. I applied the =COUNTIF() function to the rating variable. I created a mini table with each rating variable and its respective count. I highlighted the mini table and created a bar graph which then displayed my data visually.
